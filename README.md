# Crop-Yield-Prediction
# **📦 About This Repository – Crop Yield Prediction Model**
Welcome to the Crop Yield Prediction Model repository! This project aims to build a robust machine learning model that predicts crop yield (output per unit area) using historical agricultural, environmental, and input usage data from India.

📅 Dataset Period: 1997 – 2020
📊 Records: 19,689 entries
🌾 Focus: Crop yield prediction to support data-driven agricultural planning and policy-making.

# **🔍 Project Overview**
This machine learning pipeline is designed to forecast crop yield using features like:

**Crop type**

Year of cultivation

Season of sowing

Geographic state

Cultivated area

Production volume

Annual rainfall

Fertilizer and pesticide usage

# **🎯 Objective**
The primary goal of this project is to build a predictive model that enables:

✅ Farmers to make informed crop and resource planning decisions

✅ Governments and agencies to forecast food production and manage resources effectively

✅ Researchers and agronomists to analyze yield trends based on climatic and agronomic inputs


# **🧠 Techniques & Tools**
This project leverages a range of machine learning algorithms, including:

SVR

Random Forest Regressor

XGBoost Regressor

LightGBM Regressor
